# WinWM

A window management system for the Windows OS for maximum efficiency. In its current state, a half-baked keylogger, and in the future a automatic screen real estate partitioner. Working on this as a pet project when I'm forced to play with Windows and when I have a time.

### Requirements

* Windows 

### Installation

Currently WIP; you can build this solution locally on Windows using Visual Studio.

### Usage

WIP.
